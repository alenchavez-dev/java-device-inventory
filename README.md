# ðŸ“¦ Java Device Inventory (CLI)
**Author:** Alen Chavez

A small Java console application that demonstrates object-oriented design and basic collection management. It models devices, manages them with a `DeviceManager`, and exposes a simple text menu via `Main`.

---

## âœ¨ What this shows recruiters
- **Java & OOP:** clear separation of model (`Device`), business logic (`DeviceManager`), and UI (`Main`).
- **Collections & searching:** store devices in memory and iterate/filter them.
- **Console UX & validation:** straightforward loop/menu, prompts, and user feedback.
- **Tooling awareness:** compiles and runs cleanly in VS Code or the terminal.
